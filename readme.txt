This plugin is built to add a widget area/sidebar after content. 

== Description ==

The plugin adds a sidebar that you can add any widget content to. The widget is then displayed on posts after the content, before the comments. You can prevent the after content widget from showing on a post from the post editor page. You can also prevent the after content widget from displaying on specific posts types or post formats. The widget can also be added to pages.
